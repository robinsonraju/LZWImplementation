{"name":"Lzwimplementation","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome \r\nThe objective is to read dictionary-based data compression techniques from David Salomon's \"Data Compression - The Complete Reference\" and to implement the famous LZW algorithm. \r\n\r\nI was hooked on to the book the moment I read the introduction! The book has some great quotes that would make the reader remember certain points while reading and very engaging tone of communication.  \r\nThe last second paragraph in the introduction did bring some smile. On why the name is \"The Complete Reference\", he says as James Joyce used to claim that if Dublin of his time were to be destroyed, it could be reconstructed from his books, substantial part of knowledge about data compression could be reconstructed from this book. viola!\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n### LZWImplementation\r\nJava Implementation of LZW compression algorithm. \r\n\r\n### Canterbury Corpus\r\nThe Canterbury Corpus is a collection of files introduced in 1997 to provide an alternative \r\nto the Calgary corpus for evaluating lossless compression methods.
